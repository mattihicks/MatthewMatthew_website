                <p>My name is Matthew, though my friends call me Matti. I was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after high school, I moved to Seattle, where I earned my degree at the University of Washington and spent eight years.</p>

            <p>Later, I moved to Europe, where I worked at a number of different companies and eventually settled in the Netherlands. Throughout all of it, while holding down full-time jobs, I kept writing. At a certain point, I decided to take myself seriously as a writer.</p>

            <p>Today, I still work as a UX designer and researcher, but I write novels in the early mornings, late at night, and on weekends.</p>

            <p>I've owned this domain since the early 2000s. Over the years, platforms came and went, including WordPress, Squarespace, and Wix, and social media narrowed personal expression into square images and short-form videos. Somewhere along the way, I felt like I lost my own creativity on the web.</p>

            <p>This personal website is a way back. A way to reconnect with the web as a creative space. To experiment again. To find my footing without worrying too much about polish or purpose. I built this site myself.</p>

            <p>This page is mine. It's not for my employer. It's not for monetization. It's simply a place for the things I want to share, writing, thoughts, fragments, experiments. A place to be.</p>

            <p>You're very welcome to join me here if you're interested. If you're not, that's completely fine too. No hard feelings.</p>

                <p>Thanks for being here. Xx</p>
