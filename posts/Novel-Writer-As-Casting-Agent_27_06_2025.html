            <p>We both know this is made up. But we also know this is a role of a lifetime. I'm auditioning you to play a very difficult character. This will be the pinnacle of your career. Nothing you have done before or will do after will be better than this.</p>

            <p>You have the right look. The right voice. The right body movements. You are perfect for the role. I think.</p>

            <p>Just don't fuck it up.</p>
