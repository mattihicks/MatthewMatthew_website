            <p>I wrote four first drafts of my second novel. The first three were wrong.</p>

            <p>For me, the second draft is always the hardest. A reckoning: what did I spend the last three months on? But also demands I answer: <em>is this the story I really want to tell?</em><p>

            <p><strong>2021.</strong> For my first novel*, I was struck by how difficult it was to go from first draft to second. Everything—and I mean everything—was a mess. So I worked for a year on editing. On deepening the story onward through eight further drafts.</p>

            <p><strong>2022-2025.</strong> For the second novel, I knew going from first to second draft would be difficult. But I had this gut wrenching feeling that no: this wasn't the right story. I just knew it. I had to outline a new story, and write a new first draft. (For me, a draft means a complete manuscript—around 70-80K words.) After doing so, I was like: no—this also isn't right. So I did another first draft. And you know what? That draft was also not right, so I did another first draft and the whole thing fucking clicked. I knew when it clicked, because I just felt like it was the right story. Finally, finally, finally, I had a first draft I could work with.</p>

            <p><strong>2025.</strong> For the third novel, I wrote a first draft and was like: no—this wasn't right. So i outlined another version, and it also wasn't right. Outlined again and again. Wrote seven different outlines. But it just wasn't right, so I said to myself: don't start this one yet. Wait until you're ready.</p>

            <p><strong>2026.</strong> So I started another novel, my fourth, and I'm thinking this will be a "cleaner" first draft, a faster one. I'm being more diligent about what feels true to the characters and the story. I won't say this will be the final "first draft". But a writer knows when what they have is kinda good, kinda solid and I think this is. Through four books, my instincts as a writer are faster—I hope. I just have to keep going to find out.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 2rem;">*Technically, I wrote a first novel in 2013 that was horrible, so I don't count it in this list.</p>
