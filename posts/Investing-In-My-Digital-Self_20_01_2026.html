            <h2>Investing in My Digital Self</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <p>I got pissed a couple weeks ago after I linked my Substack and anyone who opened it was shown a big popup: SIGN UP FOR SUBSTACK. Why couldn't people just access my content? Why make this so difficult?</p>

            <p>So I decided to create my own website. It's been ages—and I mean ages—since I've had my own website for myself. Me, myself, I. For the last twenty years it's been focused on having a professional portfolio to show my UX projects.</p>

            <p>But I'm writing a novel. I'm querying. I want the world to see me as more than a UX'er. I want my writing to reach creative people. To possibly help them.</p>

            <p>So yes, I own this space. I coded it. And for some odd reason, I feel so happy about this. Insanely happy. Because for years and years I've only had the Instagram presence. The portfolio presence. The Facebook presence.</p>

            <p>But not the <em>me</em> presence.</p>

            <p>I'll be writing about my creative process, ideas that inspire me, and practicing being myself on this scary web.</p>

            <p>This starts now.</p>
