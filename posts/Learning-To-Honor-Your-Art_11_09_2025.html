            <p class="date">September 11, 2025</p>

            <p>Ten years ago I bought a book called The Creative License. As soon as I received it I opened the book, closed it, and never opened it again. It seemed appalling to me I would need a license, similar to a driver's license, to be creative.</p>

            <p>But the responsibilities built up.</p>

            <p>A husband. A kid. A busy job, then burn out.</p>

            <p>I told myself: I don't have time to write, I need to focus on my basic needs. My health.</p>

            <p>But writing makes me feel most alive.</p>

            <p>To work on a project. To be in the trenches of a project, is everything to me.</p>

            <p>Last January my son woke up each morning and picked up the iPad to write his story. It was like he was hungry to write. I recognized that hunger as my own. Then, the following Sunday, my partner left a lunch early so he could work on a legal matter. That stuff is his passion.</p>

            <p>So, I saw my son—he was doing what he had to do. My partner—the same. Instinctively, they were giving themselves permission.</p>

            <p>So why wasn't I writing?</p>

            <p>I opened up Jonah, a Ripley-esque literary fiction novel about a young guy who both admires and ultimately tries to destroy his wealthy uncle's life. I think I was only in draft 2 or 3. The problems were immense. the story was all wrong. I'd rewritten the first draft twice. I didn't even know really what the story was about.</p>

            <p>But I dug in. I gave myself permission to focus on this story, these characters, this other world that I had built and had been working on for so long.</p>

            <p>So, permission is not something to be taken for granted. We have to give it to ourselves over and over again.</p>
