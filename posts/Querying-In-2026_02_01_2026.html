            <h2>Querying in 2026</h2>
            <p class="date">January 2, 2026</p>

            <p>I've always hated the term 'query trenches'. As if it's a terrible experience you have to survive. I'll be querying in a couple weeks. For non-writers, querying is a time when we submit emails to literary agents, asking them to represent our books to publishing.</p>

            <p>I'd previously queried a novel in 2021 after working two years on that novel. 4am early mornings, late nights, every weekend, vacation time. I gave that novel my all and it just didn't land with the market—abstract hook, unclear stakes. After sending it to 21 agents, I got only two full MS requests and no bites.</p>

            <p>Here's what I'm doing differently in 2026:</p>

            <p><strong>Focusing on the hook.</strong> Hook, hook, hook. How can I encapsulate my story in one short sentence? Mine has changed a million times, but I think I got it.</p>

            <p><strong>Good comps.</strong> Previously, I'd just comp with my favorite authors and be like "yeah, I'm kind of like them…' but now: no, no, no. It's about how each comp is specifically tied to my novel.</p>

            <p><strong>A synopsis with clear cause-and-effect.</strong> How does each event lead to another? Are the stakes clear throughout? The different character motivations? The synopsis isn't officially a selling document, but it is because it's going to agents who haven't read your novel and checking if it has legs.</p>

            <p><strong>Research agents intensely.</strong> Being very diligent about who I send my materials to; looking at their authors lists and exactly what they're looking at now. For US agents, I also look at what they've recently sold on Publisher's Marketplace.</p>

            <p><strong>A solid MS.</strong> Character agency: Does my protagonist have a clear agency throughout the novel? Are they making choices—even if bad—for themselves? Solid momentum: Being ruthless with content that doesn't push the story forward. Also, beta readers.</p>

            <p>I'm more cautiously hopeful this time. Because of the reactions of my beta readers, because I believe in my hook. Because I know the market better. Because I know my MS is complete. And I'm also working on something new that genuinely excites me.</p>
